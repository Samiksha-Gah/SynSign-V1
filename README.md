# SynSign v1 â€” *Archived Playground*

SynSign translates American Sign Language (ASL) into coherent English sentences and burns those captions directly onto a live video feed.

This repo is a old experimental playground and is not maintained. 

If you aer interested in testing an actively-maintained release, with the model weights, please contact **[first-name]@princeton.edu** for the latest version.

Thanks!
